# Multiple_Linear_Regression

Here I implemented Multiple Linear Regression model on Kaggle data called Student_Performance.

The aim of the project is to predict how the student will perform.
The project has really good results :
Performance of the model =  98.83999999999999%
Mean Absolute Error =  164.7%
Root Mean Square Error =  2.0750664901488003
