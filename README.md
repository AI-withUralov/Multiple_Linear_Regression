# Multiple_Linear_Regression

Here, I have implemented a Multiple Linear Regression model using Kaggle data called Student_Performance.

The aim of the project is to predict how the student will perform.

The project has yielded really good results:

Performance of the model: 98.84%
Mean Absolute Error: 164.7%
Root Mean Square Error: 2.0750664901488003
